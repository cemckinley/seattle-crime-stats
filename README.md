Seattle Crime Stats App
=======================

Web app that displays a list of recent crimes and maps them on google maps. Uses data from data.seattle.gov open data API.

Currently in pieces; in transition from an unfinished old Phonegap app to a general web app using require.js and Backbone. Using Yeoman for scaffolding and build.
